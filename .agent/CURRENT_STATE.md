## Verified setup and contracts
- Boot and architecture lock pass (ADR-003 relock 9e0a5a3). Work stays on `perfection-loop`. Disposable databases use only Compose project `apexgrid-test`, ports 15432/27018. Never touch running databases, secrets or master.
- PostgreSQL owns official race data; MongoDB owns telemetry. ADR-001/002 authorize additive migrations, finding-backed contract changes, and cookie/CSRF browser auth. Existing routes/data are preserved.
- Host venv Python 3.14/Node 26 differs from backend container Python 3.12/frontend container Node 22. Runtime parity gate remains open.

## Verified gates and components
- Isolated backend gate after T-082: 90 passed, 0 failed/skipped/xfailed; live acceptance passed login, simulator, MongoDB, WebSocket, pits, standings, DBMS, generated races. T-074 additive 002 migration applied on disposable stack; F-DOM-01 and F-DOM-03 closed. `pip-audit` runtime requirements had no known vulnerabilities at last run.
- Browser matrix after T-080: 745/745 passed across five Chromium projects. Desktop axe/keyboard sweep covered all 16 routes. G11 cookie/CSRF transport and browser journeys are verified with isolated backend, live acceptance and full browser gates. Steward time/grid controls are disabled with accessible guidance; focused desktop/mobile journey passed.
- Cookie auth: session/CSRF cookies, Origin checks, protected-write signed CSRF, cookie WebSocket, browser credentialed fetch, cookie-only /me, server logout and user-only browser login JSON are implemented. No-Origin bearer API and legacy WebSocket clients remain supported. T-069 verifies logout CSRF request and retry on 503. `getToken` removed by T-070.
- Frontend typecheck and webpack production build passed at last run. Phase 0 CI/full-gates harness accepted; `.agent/commands.env` has real E2E and zero-warning lint commands.

## Ratchet and open risks
- Ruff 641 baseline -> 633 current; mypy strict 311 baseline; frontend strict lint 45 explicit-any errors. Ruff format 7 files at baseline. Coverage overall 72% isolated baseline; domain/service 90% target, overall 80% target remain open. Frontend npm audit had 7 high/2 moderate dev-tool findings; safe upgrade path open.
- F-ACE01 P2: login has no attempt throttling. T-006 twice failed: five-state fixtures need a route-specific applicability matrix before T-026..028. Role journeys, permissions matrix, simulator invariants, frontend visual states, docs, performance and evaluation score remain open in NEXT_STATE/queue.
- Phase 1 A/C/E continues. F-DOM-02 P1 remains: stored time/grid penalties do not affect official results. ADR-003 rejects new ineffective sanctions and preserves legacy rows. T-082 adds `provisional` result/standing metadata; focused and full isolated DB gate passed. T-083 strict browser xfails reproduce missing session/standings labels across desktop/mobile; T-084 UI fix next. Archive label and later full enforcement remain. F-DOM-04/05 telemetry/simulator, F-ACE01 throttling and frontend supply-chain findings remain open.

## Orchestrator direct edits and Taste review
- Product: one `frontend/package.json` build-script line switched Next build to webpack (e854d9b). No other product-source edits.
- Removed accepted G11 xfail marker lines in backend/browser tests after focused verification; each corresponding isolated backend/browser suite was rerun. Corrected signed-out login mock (one test line), live WS fixture (19 test lines), and logout test breakpoint (one line, 768→700) to match CSS. Removed F-DOM-01/03/02 guard and steward UI xfail markers; full backend/browser gates passed. Removed one T-081 provisional xfail marker after T-082 acceptance; full isolated gate passed 90/0/0. Taste after T-080: no new focal, palette, clutter or bloat defect; existing large-file/spacing debt remains queued.
