# Perfection loop
branch: perfection-loop
phase: 0 — safety net, in progress
cycle: 0 of 8
score: NOT_RUN

## Phase 0 baseline
- Architecture lock passed at boot (`4cd5bc0272d02c031ca5ea833f1f07b200444efa866448f4549a5f68dab7ca73`).
- Isolated `apexgrid-test` run (2026-10-21): 57 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped; live acceptance passed against loopback API on port 18000. T-002 paginated `/events` to find the seeded round 3 event.
- Initial host baseline with DB URLs unset: ruff 641 violations (E501 353, B008 85, E701 53, E702 39, UP017 31, C901 12), ruff format 7 files, mypy strict 311 errors. Frontend typecheck and existing lint exit 0; strict zero-warning lint is pending a corrected command.
- Host pytest: 31 passed, 26 skipped; coverage overall 44.58% (777/1743 lines), app module percentages: bootstrap 0.0, config 88.2, database 50.0, main 43.6, race_archive 97.1. These numbers are not an isolated-stack baseline.
- Docker and local sockets required scoped sandbox escalation; the isolated stack started and was seeded successfully.
- Existing Playwright config and 16-route smoke test require stronger authenticated journey coverage. Login keyboard audit and responsive run are open from prior work.

## Findings
- None assessed in this loop yet. Historical risks remain in CURRENT_STATE.md and NEXT_STATE.md.

## Blocked
- None confirmed for the isolated database baseline. Browser and quality gates remain open.
